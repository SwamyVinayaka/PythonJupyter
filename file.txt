That is totally possible! What we need in order to do that is called a “cascade classifier for Haar features” to point OpenCV at. A cascade classifier basically tells OpenCV what to look for in images. In the example above a classifier for face features was being used. There are a lot of cascade classifiers floating around on the internet and you can easily find a different one and use it. But most of them are for recognizing faces, eyes, ears and mouths though and it would be great if we could tell OpenCV to recognize an object of our choice. We need a cascade classifier that tells OpenCV how to recognize a banana.

,,Here’s the good news: we can generate our own cascade classifier for Haar features. Over in computer vision land that’s called “training a cascade classifier”. Even better news: it’s not really difficult. And by “not really” I mean it takes time and a certain amount of willingness to dig through the internet to find the relevant information and tutorials on how to do it, but you don’t need a PhD and a lab.

,,The following instructions are heavily based on Naotoshi Seo’s immensely helpful notes on OpenCV haartraining and make use of his scripts and resources he released under the MIT licencse. This is an attempt to provide a more up-to-date step-by-step guide for OpenCV 2.x that wouldn’t be possible without his work — Thanks Naotoshi!,,That is totally possible! What we need in order to do that is called a “cascade classifier for Haar features” to point OpenCV at. A cascade classifier basically tells OpenCV what to look for in images. In the example above a classifier for face features was being used. There are a lot of cascade classifiers floating around on the internet and you can easily find a different one and use it. But most of them are for recognizing faces, eyes, ears and mouths though and it would be great if we could tell OpenCV to recognize an object of our choice. We need a cascade classifier that tells OpenCV how to recognize a banana.
,,
,,Here’s the good news: we can generate our own cascade classifier for Haar features. Over in computer vision land that’s called “training a cascade classifier”. Even better news: it’s not really difficult. And by “not really” I mean it takes time and a certain amount of willingness to dig through the internet to find the relevant information and tutorials on how to do it, but you don’t need a PhD and a lab.

What we need in order to do that is called a “cascade classifier for Haar features” to point OpenCV at. A cascade classifier basically tells OpenCV what to look for in images. In the example above a classifier for face features was being used. There are a lot of cascade classifiers floating around on the internet and you can easily find a different one and use it. But most of them are for recognizing faces, eyes, ears and mouths though and it would be great if we could tell OpenCV to recognize an object of our choice. We need a cascade classifier that tells OpenCV how to recognize a banana.

,,Here’s the good news: we can generate our own cascade classifier for Haar features. Over in computer vision land that’s called “training a cascade classifier”. Even better news: it’s not really difficult. And by “not really” I mean it takes time and a certain amount of willingness to dig through the internet to find the relevant information and tutorials on how to do it, but you don’t need a PhD and a lab.

,,The following instructions are heavily based on Naotoshi Seo’s immensely helpful notes on OpenCV haartraining and make use of his scripts and resources he released under the MIT licencse. This is an attempt to provide a more up-to-date step-by-step guide for OpenCV 2.x that wouldn’t be possible without his work — Thanks Naotoshi!,,That is totally possible! What we need in order to do that is called a “cascade classifier for Haar features” to point OpenCV at. A cascade classifier basically tells OpenCV what to look for in images. In the example above a classifier for face features was being used. There are a lot of cascade classifiers floating around on the internet and you can easily find a different one and use it. But most of them are for recognizing faces, eyes, ears and mouths though and it would be great if we could tell OpenCV to recognize an object of our choice. We need a cascade classifier that tells OpenCV how to recognize a banana.
,,
,,Here’s the good news: we can generate our own cascade classifier for Haar features. Over in computer vision land that’s called “training a cascade classifier”. Even better news: it’s not really difficult. And by “not really” I mean it takes time and a certain amount of willingness to dig through the internet to find the relevant information and tutorials on how to do it, but you don’t need a PhD and a lab.
